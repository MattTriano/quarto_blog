    "# Securely access your devices anywhere with Tailscale\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to connect to your home network while away from home? Or have you wanted to let someone else connect to a something you're hosting locally? [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) makes this possible by creating private, encrypted networks that connect your devices and services seamlessly. With support for Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android - plus a generous free tier for up to 3 users and 100 devices - it's an excellent solution for both engineers and more casual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why I love Tailscale\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I found Tailscale, if I wanted to connect remotely to machines on my home network, I'd have to wrestle with my ISP to get a static IP address, know my home network's public IP, configure my router to listen for me, and manually navigate the maze of SSH and firewall security configurations. And if I wanted to connect remotely via my phone, well, I wouldn't have had the first idea how to do that safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tailscale transforms this experience. Here's what it enables me to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote SSH Access**: Connecting to my homelab server is now trivially simple. I enter this command, `tailscale ssh homelab-name`, open the returned URL, and authenticate in a browser, and I get access to my private network Tailscale (aka my **tailnet**). No more fighting network configurations, moving `ssh` keys around, editing `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, debugging terrible doublt-NAT setups, or navigating networking headaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote Service Access**: Reaching services running on my homelab is beautifully straightforward. For example, I built and run a data warehousing platform on my homelab server, `matt-lab`. If I'm out and about but I want to update a dataset, thanks to Tailscale, I can run the dataset's ELT pipeline through my platform's Airflow web UI (on port `8080`) by pulling out my phone and opening `matt-lab:8080` in a browser. Or if I was struck by a data question, thanks to Tailscale, I can explore datasets and run queries through my platform's Superset UI (on port `8088`) by going to `matt-lab:8088`.\n",

    "\n",
    "* In **ssh**: define which users/groups (**src**) can `ssh` into which devices (**dst**), the **action** `ssh` take (either just **accept** the connection request or **check** the user by requiring reauthentication every 12 hours), and the username(s) that **src** members can `ssh` into.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In **tests**: define tests that check that specified users/gropups can or cannot connect to specified device-ports.\n",
    "    * These tests run whenever the ACL file is saved.\n",
