    "# How to securely access resources via Tailscale\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is a tool for setting up private end-to-end encrypted networks that securely connect users to services and devices. It is pretty easy to set up, has a very generous free tier (up to 3 users and up to 100 devices), and has excellent cross-platform support (so you can connect devices running Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, or Android).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How I use Tailscale\n",
    "\n",
    "I mainly use tailscale to `ssh` into my homelab server and access (via browser) applications running on my homelab server. Tailscale does some heavy lifting [under the hood](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works) to make this process nearly frictionless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before tailscale, if I wanted to `ssh` into a machine on my home network (ie a homelab) while I was away from home, it was a [complex chore](#manual-ssh) that would involve knowing your home network's public IP address, defending against dynamic IP reassignment (or procuring a static IP address from your ISP), and manually managing ssh hardening.\n",
    "And if I wanted to use my phone to remotely access a service running on a machine on my home network, I'd have to figure that out (the utility-to-work ratio seemed so bad that I never entertained trying).\n",
    "\n",
    "With tailscale, after a little setup, to `ssh` into a machine on my home network, I just have to:\n",
    "1. enter command `tailscale ssh homelab-name` and\n",
    "2. authenticate with tailscale via returned URL\n",
    "then I get a shell on my homelab.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a homelab service from my phone, it's even easier. If the homelab device's name (in tailscale) is `matt-lab` and the service is running on port `8080`, I can access the service via a browser on my phone by going to `matt-lab:8080`.\n",
