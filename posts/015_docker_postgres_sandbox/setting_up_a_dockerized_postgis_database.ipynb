    "I've worked with SQL regularly over the past decade, but over the first half of that decade (and despite extensive formal knowledge of normalization, data modeling, and other database-related topics) I essentially only used SQL to extract data and use Python or R to do analysis. I only had access to production databases and I didn't know enough about how database management system work to risk experiments, and as a result, I learned at a glacial pace. But in 2018, I stumbled into a project interesting enough to motivate me to install PostGIS on a personal machine and freed from the fear of accidentally taking down a production system (and the power of a superuser), I was able to lift up the hood and see how the machine worked, and this enabled me to learn and build with Postgres + PostGIS (a geospatial Postgres extension) far faster.\n",

    "## What is Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker and Docker Compose[^1] enable you to import and run complicated applications in just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The internals of docker are really interesting, but for this post, all you need to know these things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A docker **image** is like a blueprint of an application, and it's defined in **Dockerfiles**.\n",
    "2. A docker **container** is a runnable instance of the application, built from the instructions in the blueprint.\n",
    "3. You can configure your application in a `docker-compose.yml` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Dockerfile\n",
    "The first one may sound complicated, as the contents of our Dockerfile show, this can only take one line of code (from us). That's possible because Dockerfiles can build an image based on another image, and the developers of many open source projects (e.g. Ubuntu, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, MySQL, Go, nginx, etc) public official images on [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=). Our Dockerfile pulls the [postgis/postgis image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis) (translated, it pulls the `postgis` base image from the `postgis` organization), and then adds nothing else. So in one line, we indicate that we want the `postgis/postgis` image that has the tag \"15-3.3\" (which they've intuitively used to indicate the image provides a PostGIS database that has version 15-3.3)."

In either setup, docker should still become available to you via the command line, so instructions in this post should work.\n",

This is great for reproducibility (you always get a new, clean instance based on your image), but you don't want the data you ingest into your database to get wiped every time you shut down your system, so you can define a persistent **volume** that will live on in the host system."
